1. Who was the top salesperson for the year?
Abraham Bennet had the most sales during the year. However Dirk Stringer had the highest average dollar amount, mostly because of client 18723, who purchased a very expensive item 20 seperate times from Dirk.

2. How much better did the top salesperson do than the individual who came in second for the year?
Abraham had a total of 118 sales, and he outsold the runner up by 48 sales.

3. Was there any relationship between the average sale amount for the top salespersons and the total sales?
The relationship between average sale amount and top salesperson is weak at best. The wide range of prices that items could be sold for, and the fact that the quantity of items can change per sale make it difficult to show any correlation at all.


4. How do you think the top selling salesperson gained so many sales? What was their strategy?

- Did they sell to many customers, or a dedicated few?
- Did they tend to sell a few big ticket (high priced) items, or did they focus on a high volume of lower priced items?

 Abraham sold many items to many customers, with many of the customers being repeat customers. Only a couple of the items that he sold were higher than the average price of all products, so he mostly focused on volume, instead of high ticket items.

 Dirk Stringer on the other hand sold to only three customers, and each customer only bought 1 item in many quantities. Two of the three items he sold where very high ticket items, and one was just an auxillary item with a cost of $0.00. The key for him seemed to be the repeating customers who often needed a lot of the expensive pieces. This is arguably a better tactic as it can increase revenue with less effort. However that depends on the operating costs of the rest of the business.

5. What was the top selling product for the year? What was the lowest selling? (For both dollar amount sold and quantity sold).

The top selling product by dollar amount was Mountain-100 Silver.

The top selling product by quantity sold was a three way tie between 'External Lock Washer 7', 'Mountain-100 Black, 38', and 'Touring-3000 Blue, 54'.
The most exciting of which is the 'Mountain-100 Black, 38' a it is one of the most expensive products.


6. What problems did you find in the data? (For example, where there any products without a price?)
There were quite a few items with out a price, they seemed to mostly be on auxilliary hardware, so I assumed that they were complimentary items to anyone who does business for the main products.

An additional issue that I noticed is that often the productID and the quantity sold in the transaction was identical, which I assume to be a coincidence until told otherwise.

One last issue is that I seem to be doing only analysis on the product, and how many transacitons occured, where it might be much more beneficial to expand the information to include the quantity of each item sold, the production cost of each item, and the overall net gain to the company per sales person. Although I do understand that we don't live in a perfect world, and we must make decisions with incomplete information.
